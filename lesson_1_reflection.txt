How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    "i'ts kind of cool, but tooks a lot of time to get the bug"

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    "seriously i think_ w/o the help of git-like programes, i will easily give-up
     on certain problems, and start the program all over- from the scratch,"

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    " manual saving is better, because it'll make my logs very concise.
      but autosave could make lots of un-necessary logs "

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    "because some files could be inter-related to each other, like in android dev.
     you'll gonna use manifest, xml and js inter-relatively"

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    " git log --stat file1.txt ..fileN.txt, and then use 'git diff file1 file2' 
          to pinpoint the changes that are there"

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    " it'll really make my task much easier"

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

   "i will get back to android dev. course, cos i really love it."
