what is branch in git's working evironment?
==========================================
  "i just learned that 'git branch' is very nice and helpful
   just by running 'git branch' shows the current branch, and
   'git branch @@@' that will create new branch with a name @@
         running 'git branch checkout @@' sets @@ as current branch "


still on branching:
===============================
"branching does not ends only on lineer format, a branch could be 
inaccessible if i branch out of it and went to another and add more
commit in there, so to say, the scope of a branch is limited to it's 
- and may not be accessible outside of it. i note that new branch could 
be made simply by 'git branch -b new_branchname"

a try on merge:
==================
it's not easy as expected, because i saw cbucky merging as it's easy.
after trying to merge the two branches i found and error which cbucky
have never talked about. the says there's a conflict which i have to 
resolve before proceeding with merging, i think i have give it a break.
